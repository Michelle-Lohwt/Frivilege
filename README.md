# FRIVILEGE

According to Solid Waste Management and Public Cleansing Corporation (SW Corp), the food waste produced in 2020 can easily feed up to 2.2 million people 3 times a day. However, 80% of them ends up in a landfill. On average, Malaysia Household of 5 spends RM900 a month on food and throws away RM 225  of food per month, which is RM 2700 per year.

The prototype includes:
- Login and Sign Up
- Home Page
- Notification
- Suggested Recipe based on the food list in the refridgerator
- Receipt and Food Scanning to detect food life span
- Foods in the user's refridgerator
- - Life Span Analysis
